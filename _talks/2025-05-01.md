I had the privilege to be invited to the [Symposium](https://vu.nl/en/events/2025/symposium-on-the-occasion-of-prof-henri-bal-s-retirement) organized for the retirement of professor [Henri Bal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Bal) at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Since the topic was on sustainability and HPC, I opted to put together work on carbon emissions in multi-tenant services combined with our latest papers on the energy consumption of cloud-native applications. The slides of the talk are available [here](https://vandriko.github.io/files/Greener_clouds-Bal_Symposium_plus.pdf).
